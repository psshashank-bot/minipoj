Build an AI-powered mobile or desktop application that uses facial recognition to detect a user's mood in real time and automatically plays a curated playlist matching that emotional state.

Core Features:

Face Scanning & Emotion Detection: Use computer vision and deep learning (e.g., OpenCV + a pre-trained emotion recognition model like FER2013) to detect and classify facial expressions into moods such as happy, sad, angry, relaxed, surprised, etc.

Mood-Based Music Mapping: Link each detected mood to a specific genre or playlist (e.g., happy → upbeat pop, sad → mellow acoustic, angry → hard rock, relaxed → chill lo-fi).

Music Integration: Connect to music streaming APIs like Spotify or Apple Music to fetch and play the appropriate playlist in real time.

User Preferences: Allow users to customize their mood-to-playlist mapping and save favorite playlists.

Real-time Feedback Loop: Optionally re-scan user face at intervals to update music based on mood shifts.

Tech Stack Suggestions:

Frontend: Flutter, React Native (mobile); Electron, React (desktop)

Backend/AI: Python (with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for emotion detection), Flask/FastAPI

APIs: Spotify API, Google Cloud Vision or Microsoft Azure Face API (for facial emotion analysis)

Optional Add-ons:

Dark/light mode UI with animated mood visuals

Mood history tracker

Offline playlist caching

Voice assistant for hands-free control
